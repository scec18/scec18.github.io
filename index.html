				 Supercomputers are used to power discoveries and to reduce the time-to-results in a wide variety of disciplines such as engineering, physical sciences, and healthcare. They are globally considered as vital for staying competitive in defense, research and development activities in various disciplines, financial sector, several mainstream businesses and even agriculture. An integral requirement for enabling the usage of the supercomputers, like any other computer, is the availability of the software. Scalable and efficient software is typically required for optimally using the large-scale supercomputing platforms, and thereby, effectively leveraging the investments in the advanced CyberInfrastructure (CI). However, developing and maintaining such software is challenging due to several factors, such as, 1) no well-defined processes or guidelines for writing software that can ensure high-performance on supercomputers, and 2) shortfall of trained workforce having skills in both software engineering and supercomputing. With the rapid advancement in the computer architecture discipline, the complexity of the processors that are used in the supercomputers is also increasing, and, in turn, the task of developing efficient software for supercomputers is further becoming challenging and complex. To mitigate such challenges, there is a need for a common platform that brings together different stakeholders from the areas of supercomputing and software engineering. To provide such a platform, the second workshop on "Software Challenges to Exascale Computing (SCEC)" is being organized in Delhi, India, in December 2018.
				 <br/>
		          	 <p class="fontType justified">The SCEC18 workshop will not only inform the participants about the challenges in large-scale HPC software development but will also steer them in the direction of building international collaborations for finding solutions to those challenges. The workshop will provide a forum through which hardware vendors and software developers can communicate with each other and influence the architecture of the next generation supercomputing systems and the supporting software stack. By fostering cross-disciplinary associations, the workshop will serve as a stepping-stone towards innovations in the future.

																<span class="bold">Abstract: </span>This talk will focus on challenges in designing HPC, Deep Learning,
																Big Data, and HPC Cloud middleware for Exascale systems with millions
																of processors and accelerators. For the HPC domain, we will discuss
																about the challenges in designing runtime environments for MPI+X (PGAS
																- OpenSHMEM/UPC/CAF/UPC++, OpenMP, and CUDA) programming models by
																taking into account support for multi-core systems (Xeon, ARM and
																OpenPower), high-performance networks, GPGPUs (including GPUDirect
																RDMA), and energy-awareness. Features, sample performance numbers and
																best practices of using MVAPICH2 libraries (http://mvapich.cse.ohio-
																state.edu)will be presented. For the Deep Learning domain, we will
																focus on popular Deep Learning frameworks (Caffe, CNTK, and
																TensorFlow) to extract performance and scalability with MVAPICH2-GDR
																MPI library. For the Big Data domain, we will focus on high-
																performance and scalable designs of Spark and Hadoop (including HDFS,
																MapReduce, RPC, and HBase) and the associated Deep Learning frameworks
																using native RDMA support for InfiniBand and RoCE. Finally, we will

																<span class="bold">Abstract: </span>One of the major computational challenges of modern astrophysics is quantifying
																how galaxies are grouped or clustered. Galaxy clustering is determined by a
																combination of universal cosmological parameters, gravity, and the physics of
																galaxy formation. Quantifying galaxy clustering requires computing pair-wise
																separations-- an inherently quadratic process. Consequently, comparing the
																observed clustering of galaxies to that theoretically predicted is both useful
																to advance our understanding of physics and extremely technically
																complex. Since observational studies of galaxies and the theoretical models,
																contain millions of galaxies, computing the clustering strength becomes a
																bottleneck in the analysis pipeline. Here I present Corrfunc -- a suite of
																OpenMP-parallelized clustering codes that target current CPU micro-architecture
																with custom Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX512F, AVX) and Streaming SIMD
																Extensions (SSE) intrinsics. By design, Corrfunc is highly optimized and is at
																least a factor of few faster than all existing public galaxy clustering
																correlation function routines. The algorithm within Corrfunc can be easily
																adapted to a variety of different measurements and has already been implemented
																for nearest neighbour searches, group finding in galaxy surveys, weak lensing
																measurements etc.  Corrfunc is covered by a suite of tests, extensive
																documentation and is publicly available at

														<span class="bold">Abstract: </span>The increasing trend of heterogeneity and custom architectures makes software productivity and performance portability of high-performance applications extremely challenging. Compilers can play a prominent role in addressing these software challenges. However, a fundamental challenge faced by optimizing compilers is that of modeling and minimizing data movement overheads. The cost of data movement currently dominates the cost of arithmetic/logic operations, both in terms of energy and time. While computational complexity of algorithms in terms of elementary arithmetic/logic operations is quite well understood, the same is not true of the data movement complexity of computations. More effective models of data movement complexity are needed for building effective optimizing compilers for current/emerging platforms. One promising approach is to develop domain/pattern specific optimization strategies.

														<span class="bold">Abstract: </span>The properties of engineering materials are decided by their microstructure -- the structure of materials at length scales larger than atomic but smaller than the visible range. The microstructures can be tuned during the processing of materials; and, during service conditions, these microstructures continue to evolve. Thus, the formation and evolution of microstructures is one of the key areas of materials engineering. Continuum models known as phase field models have been used in the last three decades to model microstructural evolution. These models are physics based; they help us understand the reasons and mechanisms behind microstructural evolution; they are also useful in designing microstructures of engineering materials. Thus, phase field models are of both academic and practical interest. One of the challenges in implementing phase field models is computational; in this presentation, I will make an attempt to show the need for validated and benchmarked open source phase field codes and large scale computations using such codes in order to make progress in developing advanced materials.<br/>

																					<span class="bold">Abstract: </span>Several countries are vying for HPC (High Performance Computing) leadership because supercomputers are seen as the most powerful tool for research and innovation in all
disciplines. After having crossed the 100 PetaFlops barrier, HPC players are now looking
forward to achieving the Exascale target. It is predicted that the first exascale system will be
built by the year 2020. Several countries including USA, China, Japan, France and Russia
launched their exascale initiatives more than a decade ago. India joined this League of Nations
in 2013 with the preparation of its National Supercomputing Mission (NSM) project proposal,
which was approved by the Government in 2015. The Top500 list of supercomputers
announced every six months provides a fairly good idea of the pace of developments in
supercomputing and the major players. Those making inferences from this list often wonder if
India at all continues to be among the exascale players. In this presentation, I shall make an
attempt to answer this question and discuss the challenges in the Indian approach to exascale

																					<span class="bold">Abstract: </span>Several countries are vying for HPC (High Performance Computing) leadership because
supercomputers are seen as the most powerful tool for research and innovation in all
disciplines. After having crossed the 100 PetaFlops barrier, HPC players are now looking
forward to achieving the Exascale target. It is predicted that the first exascale system will be
built by the year 2020. Several countries including USA, China, Japan, France and Russia
launched their exascale initiatives more than a decade ago. India joined this League of Nations
in 2013 with the preparation of its National Supercomputing Mission (NSM) project proposal,
which was approved by the Government in 2015. The Top500 list of supercomputers
announced every six months provides a fairly good idea of the pace of developments in
supercomputing and the major players. Those making inferences from this list often wonder if
India at all continues to be among the exascale players. In this presentation, I shall make an
attempt to answer this question and discuss the challenges in the Indian approach to exascale
computing.<br/>

			<p>
We invite authors to submit their original and unpublished work, that is not under review for another publication. Full papers (10 -15 pages in length including references) should be formatted as per the Springer-specified guidelines (details below) for the double-blind review.

<br> <br/>
We also invite short papers or extended abstracts for the lightning talks. The short papers should also be prepared following the Springer guidelines, and could be 6-9 pages in length including references. A selected number of short papers will also be included in the workshop proceedings. While all the short papers will NOT be published in the proceedings, they will be archived and made publicly accessible through Figshare and a Github repo. These submissions will have a DOI number for future citations. Those interested in presenting lightning talks are also required to submit the PDF copies of the rough draft of their slides. The PDFs of the abstract and the slides can be merged into a single PDF file, and can be uploaded to Easychair for peer-review.

<br> <br/>
The PDF version of the papers/extended abstracts can be submitted for review through the SCEC 2018 submission website :<br /></p>

									Supercomputers are used to power discoveries and to reduce the time-to-results in a wide variety of disciplines such as engineering, physical sciences, and healthcare. They are globally considered as vital for staying competitive in defense, research and development activities in various disciplines, financial sector, several mainstream businesses and even agriculture. An integral requirement for enabling the usage of the supercomputers, like any other computer, is the availability of the software. Scalable and efficient software is typically required for optimally using the large-scale supercomputing platforms, and thereby, effectively leveraging the investments in the advanced CyberInfrastructure (CI). However, developing and maintaining such software is challenging due to several factors, such as, 1) no well-defined processes or guidelines for writing software that can ensure high-performance on supercomputers, and 2) shortfall of trained workforce having skills in both software engineering and supercomputing. With the rapid advancement in the computer architecture discipline, the complexity of the processors that are used in the supercomputers is also increasing, and, in turn, the task of developing efficient software for supercomputers is further becoming challenging and complex. To mitigate such challenges, there is a need for a common platform that brings together different stakeholders from the areas of supercomputing and software engineering. To provide such a platform, the second workshop on "Software Challenges to Exascale Computing (SCEC)" is being organized in Delhi, India, in December 2018.
								<br/>
		          	<p class="fontType justified">The SCEC18 workshop will not only inform the participants about the challenges in large-scale HPC software development but will also steer them in the direction of building international collaborations for finding solutions to those challenges. The workshop will provide a forum through which hardware vendors and software developers can communicate with each other and influence the architecture of the next generation supercomputing systems and the supporting software stack. By fostering cross-disciplinary associations, the workshop will serve as a stepping-stone towards innovations in the future.

																<span class="bold">Abstract: </span>Today, high-performance computing (HPC) application codes are often optimized and specialized for a particular system configuration to exploit the system's potential. One severe problem is that simply modifying an HPC application code often results in degrading the performance portability, readability, and maintainability of the code. Therefore, we have been developing a code transformation framework, Xevolver, so that users can easily define their own code transformation	rules for individual cases, in order to express how each application	code should be changed to achieve high performance. In this talk, I will briefly review the Xevolver framework and introduce some case studies to discuss the benefits of the user-defined code transformation approach.<br />

												<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract: </span>Clouds play a very important role in modulating climate by controlling radiation received at the Earth surface. In spite of their importance, their dynamics are not well understood due to simulation limitations. The lack of understanding of the hydrodynamics and the micro-physical processes in clouds causes major uncertainties in current atmospheric general circulation models. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is a three dimensional simulation approach to simulate turbulent flows at smallest scale where the equations are solved explicitly without any approximation. Running the DNS in bigger domain is compute intensive and lengthy. Hence, prior knowledge of the resources required to run DNS code can be of great advantage. A Numerical Simulation of entrainment and mixing process at cloud interface to study droplet dynamics has been carried out for smaller domains and the time to run code for bigger domain has been projected using linear regression formula. Projected time for bigger domain size will provide researcher to estimate the wall clock time as well as storage requirement, based on available computational resources, to run DNS. The simulation is carried out for different size domains and optimized number of cores has been suggested based on scaling factors for different domains. Further a 17% gain in computational time is achieved by amending algorithm, where only sparse operations are considered in place of full dense data. Use of pnetcdf library has also provided advantages over conventional I/O format.</li>

																										<li><span class="bold"><br />Manu Awasthi, <i>"DRAM Organization Aware OS Page Allocation"</i></span></li>


																										<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract: </span>The applications in HPC and datacenter domains are beginning to have increasingly larger memory footprints running into multiple tens of gigabytes. Contemporary HPC server also have multiple NUMA nodes and the NUMA factor is increasing at an alarming pace with the increase in number of NUMA nodes. As a result, the average cost of main memory access has also been increasing. Furthermore, for a typical HPC application, DRAM access latencies are a function of 1) the memory allocation policies of OS (across NUMA nodes) and 2) data layout in DRAM DIMMs (per-NUMA node).<br /><br />

																										A DRAM DIMM has a hierarchical structure where it is divided into ranks, banks, rows and columns. There are multiple such DIMMs on each channel and there could be multiple channels emanating from one memory controller. Furthermore, there could be multiple memory controllers per NUMA node. Data layout across DRAM DIMMs and channels is a function of memory controller specific policies like address mapping schemes, which potentially can differ between multiple controllers on the same node.<br /><br />

																										The OS allocates memory at the granularity of pages. Since the OS has no knowledge of the underlying architecture and organization of per-NUMA node DRAM, each OS page could potentially be concentrated to a subset of available channels, DIMMs, ranks, banks and arrays, putting them under pressure and reducing performance. In order to get most benefit out of existing architectures, it is necessary that the OS allocate memory (at page granularity) while being cognizant of the inner architecture and organization of per-NUMA node DRAM.<br /><br />

																										In this proposal, we propose mechanisms where the OS, in addition to reducing memory allocation for processes across NUMA nodes, also takes into account the organization of DRAM DIMMs (channels, ranks, banks, rows, columns etc.) for every memory controller. This will help the OS make page allocation decisions which maximize the use of available parallelism, increase locality and hence reduce overall memory access latency, decreasing application runtimes.</li>

																	<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract: </span>GPU computing is emerging as an alternative to CPUs for throughput oriented applications because of their number of cores embedded on the same chip and speed-up in computing. GPUs provide general purpose computing using dedicated libraries such as CUDA (for NVIDIA cards, based on a SIMD architecture that makes it possible to handle a very large number of hardware threads concurrently, and can be used for various purposes. This paper explains customization of a well-known open source earthquake engineering application OpenSees on hybrid platform using GPU enabled open source libraries.<br /><br />

																	Available GPU enabled version of OpenSees provided by Xinzheng Lu, Linlin Xie (Tsinghua University, China) uses CulaS4 and CulaS5, which use the Cula library and currently supported on window’s platform. Both of these limits the usage of OpenSees as an open source platform. To overcome this, we have modified existing CuSPSolver to use only freely available CUSP library. Speed up improvement is achieved by diverting analysis component to GPU architecture<br /><br />

																	GPU enablement will help researchers and scientists to use this open-source platform for their research in structural and earthquake engineering domain using OpenSees. Also as there are minor changes required to be done in the input script and no great programming efforts required to run it using GPU enabled OpenSees, these modifications are very user friendly. Speedup around 2.14x is observed when tested with some examples. Different types of examples were studied to compare the results and it has been observed that performance will increases with increase in complexity of the problem. Nodal displacement results of one of the example were compared with CPU and GPU simulations which were matching. This validates the methodology used for GPU enablement. These modifications were also integrated in the mainstream of OpenSees code at Berkley and now available to all structural engineering community. All the study carried out is for single CPU and single GPU. There is lot of scope to extend this work for multi GPU, using other accelerators and using OpenCL.</li>

																	<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract:</span>The future exascale systems are expected to have numerous heterogeneous computing resources in order to achieve computational performance against the energy consumption guidelines.  To harness these computing resources it is essential to have hybrid applications that can exploit a combination of CPU and other accelerators for execution. To optimally exploit the cluster performance offered by the heterogeneous architecture, it is necessary to schedule the application based on their exhibited characteristics. However, scheduling hybrid parallel applications is a challenging task as a single resource allocation algorithm should be able to handle multiple aspects of heterogeneity, application characteristics and accelerators’ capabilities while ensuring to achieve optimal resource utilization and good response time to all the jobs. We propose a novel resource allocation technique which makes an in-depth logical scheduling decision based on multiple criteria - characterisation of the hybrid applications, energy conservation, and network topology with resource proximity for allocation. The knowledge of prior job execution is used to self evolve the optimal resource selection mechanism. A unique enhancement has been added in the scheduler to circumvent long waiting time by dynamically adapting applications to alternate resource through re-targeting the device at runtime. This technique helps to reduced waiting time for getting the required resource, and hence improves the turnaround time for the user.  The resource allocator considers the challenges of exascale scenario and orchestrates a solution to help HPC users to get their applications executed with less waiting time with better efficiency, and assures effective resource utilization from the HPC resource administrator’s perspective.</li>

																	<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract: </span>Tremendous data growth in exascale HPC applications will generate variety of
datasets. This will impose two important challenges on the storage I/O system i) efficiently
process large data sets, ii) improved fault tolerance. The exascale storage systems are
expected to be capable enough providing bandwidth guarantee and applying coding scheme
optimized for the type of data set.<br /><br />
Traditional RAID architecture in HPC storage system is being replaced with network coding
techniques to provide optimal fault tolerance for data. There exists variation in network
codes based on traditional erasure (reed-Solomon) with number of libraries
implementations, which notably differ in terms of complexity and implementation for
specific optimizations.<br /><br />
We propose an I/O subsystem to provide bandwidth guarantee along with optimized fault
tolerance for variety of HPC/big datasets. The proposed storage I/O subsystem consists of
software defined storage gateways and controller working along with filesystem MDS. We
propose an I/O caching mechanism with hierarchical storage structure embedded at storage
gateway. The designed caching policy will cache smaller files on faster storage drives (like
SSD’s) eliminating long access latency for smaller sized files. The storage gateways are
running with systematic erasure (RS) code, with preconfigured encoding-decoding
algorithms. At each gateway, network coding (erasure coding encode-decode) is performed
at multiple tiers with specified parameter. Geometric programming is used to calculate
parameters at each tier based on data demand. The proposed system provides bandwidth
guarantee with caching mechanism at hierarchical storage layers. Flexible erasure coding
provides optimized fault tolerance for variety of application datasets.<br /><br />
Future work will focus on design of flexible caching and replacement policy for real time
workload and an adaptive encode-decode algorithm for highly skewed data demand.

																	<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract:</span>The role and need of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology in various geospatial applications is proved beyond the doubts as SAR can make available critical information about on the filed information with centimeter to millimeter accuracy. The science of processing such SAR data using the distributed computing resources is more than two decade old and as of now been broadly bolstered by worldwide HPC labs for example, ESA’s G-POD (Grid Processing on Demand), Peppers (A Performance Emphasized Production Environment for Remote Sensing), DLR distributed SAR data processing environment, Center for Earth Observation and Digital Earth (CEODE) of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),..etc. This paper discusses the difficulties and issues of Geospatial application users who are working with multiple sets of voluminous temporal SAR data and brings out the importance of developing and deploying all-purpose HPC based infrastructure environment that can meet the expectations of application users. Specific situations which require simultaneous processing of different frequency, polarization and incidence angle SAR data using the distributed HPC resources and related requirements will be discussed. For example during the SAR raw data processing, the need and importance of simultaneous processing and extraction of different polarization images as well as in completing its related post processing tasks and mapping operations will be highlighted. When the same has to be done at a regional scale, mainly to simulate large scale disaster events with various multi-look factors as well as with different post processing filtering options the need of developing and deploying such real time solutions on an exascale computing environment can be well understood. As on date such large scale complex SAR application model supporting the above mentioned expectations is yet to be developed. In line to this this talk will brings out the importance of prototyping such HPC based SAR data processing environment which can support the complete application cycle of real time regional disaster management simulations and its related operations.

																										<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract: </span>The weather forecasting has a major impact on the society. The meteorologists have been using the
numerical weather prediction models for the operation forecast for over several decades ever since
Richardson's attempt towards numerical models for weather prediction. The weather codes have
consumed a good portion of the computational power available in several supercomputing centers.
This has led to the need to improve the computational efficiency of the codes/models to achieve
better resolution moving towards the better accuracy of the forecasts. However, these large scale
computations are possible only at the expense of the huge energy budget due to the increasing
requirement of computational resources as well as the cooling infrastructure required to maintain
them. But with the energy budget fixed at 20 MW it is even more challenging as we are compelled
to move towards energy efficiency of the weather codes. We focus towards the spectral transform
method as case study for this talk. This method has been in use in NCAR and ECMWF for the
operational forecasts.<br /><br />

In this talk, we shall discuss the basics of numerical weather predictions and move towards the test
bed shallow water model to be solved by spectral transform method. The highlights of the approach
with regard to algorithm, its scalability and improvements leading to the reduction in the
computational complexity will be discussed. To conclude, some of the recent efforts on scaling up
the solver for shallow water equations are discussed along with the glimpse of the ongoing efforts in
the ESCAPE project. This talk is inspired by our project proposal on “Scalable algorithmic
approach to spectral transform method” to be pursued under NSM, India.</li>

														<span class="bold">Abstract: </span>HPC has huge future scope for scientific applications, large data bases, AI/deep learning, business applications in financial industry, telecom (particularly 5G) etc. Unfortunately, present systems are serving the market with separate products, in a rather fragmented manner. Challenge is to create a "Unified Architecture" that will unify the user space, following a "Top-down" approach instead of “Bottom-up" approach which forces applications to try to fit their code to peculiarities of particular cpu's, accelerators, system architecture etc. Today's potential of HPC and silicon technology is grossly underutilized due to effort and time spent in tailoring parallel code to specific machines.    Incorporation of FPGA-based reconfigurability in general applications is getting delayed unnecessarily. If economic benefits based on what is eminently feasible technologically, are not delivered to the society quickly enough, it slows down investments in further technological enhancements. All HPC users will benefit from this in the long run. At the same time, we are focusing on how very complex code can be put  together in shorter time-span, and in such a way that investment in top-level code design is long-lived in face of  anticipated changes in successive generations of chips, interfaces etc. Due to vast scope, we will present only a broad overview and elaborate only on couple of aspects.  Improving programmer productivity by designing and writing parallel code at multiple levels of abstraction by providing more expressive notations, tools for transforming one level to the next is required. It is also necessary to do away with artificial boundary between hardware description languages and how far traditional compilers reach starting from high level languages. This will ensure more seamless utilization of FPGA-based re-configurability in the unified system architecture. Since hardware aspects are too complex, only one particular aspect related to GPU's will be covered.  Initially, we’ll be addressing application of optimization algorithms to economic modelling and telecom systems.<br />

																										<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract: </span>Clouds play a very important role in modulating climate by controlling radiation received at the Earth surface. In spite of their importance, their dynamics are not well understood due to simulation limitations. The lack of understanding of the hydrodynamics and the micro-physical processes in clouds causes major uncertainties in current atmospheric general circulation models. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is a three dimensional simulation approach to simulate turbulent flows at smallest scale where the equations are solved explicitly without any approximation. Running the DNS in bigger domain is compute intensive and lengthy. Hence, prior knowledge of the resources required to run DNS code can be of great advantage. A Numerical Simulation of entrainment and mixing process at cloud interface to study droplet dynamics has been carried out for smaller domains and the time to run code for bigger domain has been projected using linear regression formula. Projected time for bigger domain size will provide researcher to estimate the wall clock time as well as storage requirement, based on available computational resources, to run DNS. The simulation is carried out for different size domains and optimized number of cores has been suggested based on scaling factors for different domains. Further a 17% gain in computational time is achieved by amending algorithm, where only sparse operations are considered in place of full dense data. Use of pnetcdf library has also provided advantages over conventional I/O format.</li>

																	<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract: </span>The applications in HPC and datacenter domains are beginning to have increasingly larger memory footprints running into multiple tens of gigabytes. Contemporary HPC server also have multiple NUMA nodes and the NUMA factor is increasing at an alarming pace with the increase in number of NUMA nodes. As a result, the average cost of main memory access has also been increasing. Furthermore, for a typical HPC application, DRAM access latencies are a function of 1) the memory allocation policies of OS (across NUMA nodes) and 2) data layout in DRAM DIMMs (per-NUMA node).<br /><br />

																	A DRAM DIMM has a hierarchical structure where it is divided into ranks, banks, rows and columns. There are multiple such DIMMs on each channel and there could be multiple channels emanating from one memory controller. Furthermore, there could be multiple memory controllers per NUMA node. Data layout across DRAM DIMMs and channels is a function of memory controller specific policies like address mapping schemes, which potentially can differ between multiple controllers on the same node.<br /><br />

																	The OS allocates memory at the granularity of pages. Since the OS has no knowledge of the underlying architecture and organization of per-NUMA node DRAM, each OS page could potentially be concentrated to a subset of available channels, DIMMs, ranks, banks and arrays, putting them under pressure and reducing performance. In order to get most benefit out of existing architectures, it is necessary that the OS allocate memory (at page granularity) while being cognizant of the inner architecture and organization of per-NUMA node DRAM.<br /><br />

																	In this proposal, we propose mechanisms where the OS, in addition to reducing memory allocation for processes across NUMA nodes, also takes into account the organization of DRAM DIMMs (channels, ranks, banks, rows, columns etc.) for every memory controller. This will help the OS make page allocation decisions which maximize the use of available parallelism, increase locality and hence reduce overall memory access latency, decreasing application runtimes.</li>

																	<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract: </span>GPU computing is emerging as an alternative to CPUs for throughput oriented applications because of their number of cores embedded on the same chip and speed-up in computing. GPUs provide general purpose computing using dedicated libraries such as CUDA (for NVIDIA cards, based on a SIMD architecture that makes it possible to handle a very large number of hardware threads concurrently, and can be used for various purposes. This paper explains customization of a well-known open source earthquake engineering application OpenSees on hybrid platform using GPU enabled open source libraries.<br /><br />

																	Available GPU enabled version of OpenSees provided by Xinzheng Lu, Linlin Xie (Tsinghua University, China) uses CulaS4 and CulaS5, which use the Cula library and currently supported on window’s platform. Both of these limits the usage of OpenSees as an open source platform. To overcome this, we have modified existing CuSPSolver to use only freely available CUSP library. Speed up improvement is achieved by diverting analysis component to GPU architecture<br /><br />

																	GPU enablement will help researchers and scientists to use this open-source platform for their research in structural and earthquake engineering domain using OpenSees. Also as there are minor changes required to be done in the input script and no great programming efforts required to run it using GPU enabled OpenSees, these modifications are very user friendly. Speedup around 2.14x is observed when tested with some examples. Different types of examples were studied to compare the results and it has been observed that performance will increases with increase in complexity of the problem. Nodal displacement results of one of the example were compared with CPU and GPU simulations which were matching. This validates the methodology used for GPU enablement. These modifications were also integrated in the mainstream of OpenSees code at Berkley and now available to all structural engineering community. All the study carried out is for single CPU and single GPU. There is lot of scope to extend this work for multi GPU, using other accelerators and using OpenCL.</li>

																	<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract:</span>The future exascale systems are expected to have numerous heterogeneous computing resources in order to achieve computational performance against the energy consumption guidelines.  To harness these computing resources it is essential to have hybrid applications that can exploit a combination of CPU and other accelerators for execution. To optimally exploit the cluster performance offered by the heterogeneous architecture, it is necessary to schedule the application based on their exhibited characteristics. However, scheduling hybrid parallel applications is a challenging task as a single resource allocation algorithm should be able to handle multiple aspects of heterogeneity, application characteristics and accelerators’ capabilities while ensuring to achieve optimal resource utilization and good response time to all the jobs. We propose a novel resource allocation technique which makes an in-depth logical scheduling decision based on multiple criteria - characterisation of the hybrid applications, energy conservation, and network topology with resource proximity for allocation. The knowledge of prior job execution is used to self evolve the optimal resource selection mechanism. A unique enhancement has been added in the scheduler to circumvent long waiting time by dynamically adapting applications to alternate resource through re-targeting the device at runtime. This technique helps to reduced waiting time for getting the required resource, and hence improves the turnaround time for the user.  The resource allocator considers the challenges of exascale scenario and orchestrates a solution to help HPC users to get their applications executed with less waiting time with better efficiency, and assures effective resource utilization from the HPC resource administrator’s perspective.</li>

																	<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract: </span>Tremendous data growth in exascale HPC applications will generate variety of
datasets. This will impose two important challenges on the storage I/O system i) efficiently
process large data sets, ii) improved fault tolerance. The exascale storage systems are
expected to be capable enough providing bandwidth guarantee and applying coding scheme
optimized for the type of data set.<br /><br />
Traditional RAID architecture in HPC storage system is being replaced with network coding
techniques to provide optimal fault tolerance for data. There exists variation in network
codes based on traditional erasure (reed-Solomon) with number of libraries
implementations, which notably differ in terms of complexity and implementation for
specific optimizations.<br /><br />
We propose an I/O subsystem to provide bandwidth guarantee along with optimized fault
tolerance for variety of HPC/big datasets. The proposed storage I/O subsystem consists of
software defined storage gateways and controller working along with filesystem MDS. We
propose an I/O caching mechanism with hierarchical storage structure embedded at storage
gateway. The designed caching policy will cache smaller files on faster storage drives (like
SSD’s) eliminating long access latency for smaller sized files. The storage gateways are
running with systematic erasure (RS) code, with preconfigured encoding-decoding
algorithms. At each gateway, network coding (erasure coding encode-decode) is performed
at multiple tiers with specified parameter. Geometric programming is used to calculate
parameters at each tier based on data demand. The proposed system provides bandwidth
guarantee with caching mechanism at hierarchical storage layers. Flexible erasure coding
provides optimized fault tolerance for variety of application datasets.<br /><br />
Future work will focus on design of flexible caching and replacement policy for real time
workload and an adaptive encode-decode algorithm for highly skewed data demand.

																	<li><span class="bold"><br />Abstract:</span>The role and need of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology in various geospatial applications is proved beyond the doubts as SAR can make available critical information about on the filed information with centimeter to millimeter accuracy. The science of processing such SAR data using the distributed computing resources is more than two decade old and as of now been broadly bolstered by worldwide HPC labs for example, ESA’s G-POD (Grid Processing on Demand), Peppers (A Performance Emphasized Production Environment for Remote Sensing), DLR distributed SAR data processing environment, Center for Earth Observation and Digital Earth (CEODE) of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),..etc. This paper discusses the difficulties and issues of Geospatial application users who are working with multiple sets of voluminous temporal SAR data and brings out the importance of developing and deploying all-purpose HPC based infrastructure environment that can meet the expectations of application users. Specific situations which require simultaneous processing of different frequency, polarization and incidence angle SAR data using the distributed HPC resources and related requirements will be discussed. For example during the SAR raw data processing, the need and importance of simultaneous processing and extraction of different polarization images as well as in completing its related post processing tasks and mapping operations will be highlighted. When the same has to be done at a regional scale, mainly to simulate large scale disaster events with various multi-look factors as well as with different post processing filtering options the need of developing and deploying such real time solutions on an exascale computing environment can be well understood. As on date such large scale complex SAR application model supporting the above mentioned expectations is yet to be developed. In line to this this talk will brings out the importance of prototyping such HPC based SAR data processing environment which can support the complete application cycle of real time regional disaster management simulations and its related operations. Any such operational setup certainly needs effective coordination of worldwide space agencies as well as distributed HPC labs.</li>

			<br />
			<p class="fontType justified">  SCEC 2018 workshop proceedings will be published by Springer in their prestigious Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) <a href="http://www.springer.com/series/7899" target="_blank" style="color:black">series</a>. 
			<p>
We invite authors to submit their original and unpublished work, that is not under review for another publication. Full papers (10 -15 pages in length including references) should be formatted as per the Springer-specified guidelines (details below) for the double-blind review. 

We also invite short papers or extended abstracts for the lightning talks. The short papers should also be prepared following the Springer guidelines, and could be 6-9 pages in length including references. A selected number of short papers will also be included in the workshop proceedings. While all the short papers will NOT be published in the proceedings, they will be archived and made publicly accessible through Figshare and a Github repo. These submissions will have a DOI number for future citations. Those interested in presenting lightning talks are also required to submit the PDF copies of the rough draft of their slides. The PDFs of the abstract and the slides can be merged into a single PDF file, and can be uploaded to Easychair for peer-review.

The PDF version of the papers/extended abstracts can be submitted for review through the SCEC 2018 submission website :<br /></p>

<p class="fontType justified"> The review process is double-blind, and each paper will be reviewed by at least three committee members and/or
